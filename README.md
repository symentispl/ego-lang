# Ego: philosophy

Ego has opinions, about things. Strong opinions. If you don't like it, don't use it. There are other
languages which will accept your ideas and ways of seeing things. Ego doesn't care. It wants
to stay off of the mainstream. It doesn't need fame, applause, love and care. Stay safe and fuck off.

It already knows that it is the best language ever created.

Period.

Rules. There are always some rules. Ego has few of them.

Respect the rules.

## no surprises

Avoid surprises, any surprises. Programming is not a box of chocolates. It is not here to enjoy coding.
It is not fun. Fewer surprises, more work can be done. We work hard. We love it. Ego will try hard not
to surprise you.

* no nulls
* no coercion rules
* no operator precedence
* no statements
* no global state

## less is more

Less is more. There is nothing more than can be said. Ego has a minimal set of concepts you have to know 
and understand.

* functions
* objects
* primitives
* attributes
* capabilites

## ideology-free

We don't want to be pure, pure functional, pure object-oriented. We want to be dirty because we want
to get the job done. We stay away from flame wars, Twitter discussions and anyone trying to prove
their way is the right way. If your language or paradigm is the right one, we have a message for you.
Open your mind and fuck off.

* are we static or dynamic? in general we are static, but when needed dynamic or opposite
* strongly or weakly typed? who cares
* functional or OOP? both, we love functions, but also love objects,
* there are more then one types of polymorphism, enjoy all of them
